Usually, most of the episodes follow Meena's activities which warns people about disasters, helps them fight against several diseases and inspires children to go to school and shows many other things which help people in south-east Asia in raising social awareness.

Almost in all of the episodes, her younger brother, Raju assists her many things. Her family consists of her parents, her brother, her grandmother and her youngest sister, Rani and they also pet some animals - a parrot, named Mithu, a cow named Lali and a goat, they call Munmun. Though her family members appear in every episodes, they are not main characters, rather supportive characters.

Not much is known about Meena's background, but UNICEF designed most of her habits and wishes, which are very useful for the villagers of south-east Asia so life would be much easier for them.</p>
